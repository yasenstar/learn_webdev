# D3.js in Action (2nd edition)

## Part 1 D3.js Fundamentals

[D3](http://d3js.org) stands for _data-driven documents_.

### 1. An introduction to D3.js

#### D3 is about selecting and binding

here is a selection without any data:

```
d3.selectAll("circle.a").style("fill", "red").attr("cx", 100);
```

This takes each circle on our page with the CSS class of `a`, turns it red, and moves it sothat its center is 100 pixels to the right of the left side of our `<svg>` canvas.

Below code turns every `div` on our page red and changes its class to `b`:

```
d3.selectAll("div").style("background", "red").attr("class", "b")
```

Below code binds the elements in the array [1,5,11,3] to `<div>` elements with the class of `market`:

```
d3.selectAll("div.market").data([1,5,11,3])
```

The power of HTML 5

1. Page loads with styles, data, and content as defined in traditional HTML development (This step only happens once.)
2. Display uses D3 selections of HTML elements, with or without data-binding, to modify the structure and appearance of the page.
3. Changes in page structure prompt user interaction, which causes new selections with and without data-binding to further alter the page (multiple times, depending on user interaction).

Before GIFs were weaponized to share cute animal behavior, they were your only hope for animated data visualization on the web. Few examples from the 1990s like [dpgraph.com](http://dpgraph.com/) still exist, but this page has more than enough GIFs to remind us of their dangers.
